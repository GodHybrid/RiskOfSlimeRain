Update to 1.4.4 versions of Terraria

* Items
	* ALL damage items now have a minimal damage threshold that increases as player progresses. Players are no longer required to hold a weapon for the effects to deal any damage
	* Some damage items now penetrate armor, making them not useless against high armor enemies
	* Barbed Wire now immediately triggers if an enemy enters the radius
	* Bundle Of Fireworks now spawns rockets every 50 kills, triple rockets every boss kill. The chance to fire rockets remains
	* Fire Shield now correctly displays current stack stats of the item:
		* Original stats: 200% damage -> 400% damage
		* Balanced stats: 200% damage -> 600% damage; 10 knockback -> 15 knockback
	* Medkit had its animation drastically sped up after the heal was already applied
	* Panic Mines now activate at both low HP and after taking heavy damage
		* Balanced stats: Maximum quantity of mines is limited to 8 at 8 stacks, further stacks increase the damage instead
	* Spikestrips now spawn on set X locations: covers less area if hit airborne, but is much more useful if hit while grounded
	* Taser (Balanced stats): Chance 7% -> 10%
* Misc
	* (With Boss Checklist Mod enabled) Modded bosses now only drop Common items instead of Uncommon. They will now continue dropping after you defeat 8 (or 11 in hardmode) different modded bosses
	* When hovering over items in the bottom UI, it will now hide the chat and other items
	* UI now shows total item count
	* Increased taken damage multiplier slightly if Difficulty Scaling is enabled
* Fixes
	* Fixed Bustling Mushroom healing 1 HP less than intended
	* Fixed Harvester's Scythe not counting as an Uncommon
	* Fixed Paul's Goat Hoof UI info
	* Fixed Rusty Knife having less duration than intended
	* Fixed "chests with RoSR items in it" UI tooltip not working in multiplayer
