[c/64bbde:"Risk of Slime Rain"] is a mod, that adds all the existing items from [c/332257:Risk of Rain 1] into [c/64a851:Terraria]. 

This mod offers [c/d18660:permanent upgrades] to player character through items of varying rarity. Every item is a [c/d18660:consumable] and most of them stack infinitely for increased effect, [c/d18660:upgrading] your various [c/d18660:stats] to your heart's content. 
However the recipes for them are quite expensive. Even low-tier items will require a lot of grinding! Get a nice [c/d18660:headstart by defeating bosses]: but the more items you get - the lower your chance to get a new one will be, effectively forcing you to craft them!

[c/64bbde:"Risk of Slime Rain"] is in a beta-stage as of now, offering a fraction of what the end goal is. However, it is still playable! It currently offers:
[i:3520] 24 items of [c/e9f2f2:Common] rarity - a nice variety of offensive, utility and defensive items
[i:484] 1 item of [c/6bab5c:Uncommon] rarity


[c/d18660:Multiplayer is fully supported.]
