"Risk of Slime Rain" is a mod, that adds all the existing items from [Risk of Rain 1] into Terraria. 

Every item is a consumable and can be used infinitely, increasing various stats to your heart's content. However the recipes for them are very, very expensive. Even low-tier items will require a lot of grinding.

Such is the price you have to pay for evolution...
