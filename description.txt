[c/64bbde:"Risk of Slime Rain"] is a mod that aims to add all the existing items from [c/334a8a:Risk of Rain 1] into [c/64a851:Terraria], with some tweaks to fit Terraria's gameplay and world. 

This mod offers [c/d18660:permanent upgrades] to the player character through items of varying rarity. Every item is a [c/d18660:consumable] and most of them stack infinitely for increased effect, [c/d18660:upgrading] your various [c/d18660:stats] to your heart's content. 
However the recipes for them are quite expensive. Even low-tier items will require plenty of grinding! Get a nice [c/d18660:headstart by defeating bosses]: but the more items you get - the lower your chance to get a new one will be, effectively forcing you to craft them!
The mod also features a config setting where you can selectively pick the amount of stacks each item occupies, in case you need to tweak/disable the effects. If you want the items you used back, defeat the Wall of Flesh for the [c/d18660:Nullifier] item.

[c/64bbde:"Risk of Slime Rain"] is in a beta-stage as of now, offering a fraction of what the end goal is. However, it is still playable! It currently offers:
[i:3520] 25 items of [c/e9f2f2:Common] rarity - a nice variety of offensive, utility and defensive items


[c/d18660:Multiplayer compatible, no pvp support.]
