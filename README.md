**"Risk of Slime Rain"** is a mod that aims to add all the existing items from **Risk of Rain 1** into **Terraria**, with some tweaks to fit Terraria's gameplay and world. 

This mod offers **permanent upgrades** to the player character through items of varying rarity. Every item is a **consumable** and most of them stack infinitely for increased effect, **upgrading** your various **stats** to your heart's content. 
However the recipes for them are quite expensive. Even low-tier items will require plenty of grinding! Get a nice **headstart by defeating bosses**: but the more items you get - the lower your chance to get a new one will be, effectively forcing you to craft them!
The mod also features a config setting where you can selectively pick the amount of stacks each item occupies, in case you need to tweak/disable the effects. If you want the items you used back, defeat the Wall of Flesh for the **Nullifier** item.

**"Risk of Slime Rain"** is in a beta-stage as of now, offering a fraction of what the end goal is. However, it is still playable! It currently offers:
25 items of **Common** rarity - a nice variety of offensive, utility and defensive items.


_Multiplayer compatible, no pvp support._
