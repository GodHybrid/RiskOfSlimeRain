**"Risk of Slime Rain"** is a mod that aims to add all the existing items from **Risk of Rain 1** into **Terraria**, with some tweaks to fit Terraria's gameplay and world. 

This mod offers **permanent upgrades** to the player character through items of varying rarity. Every item is a **consumable** and most of them stack infinitely for increased effect, **upgrading** your various **stats** to your heart's content. 
However the recipes for them are quite expensive (non-Commons aren't craftable at all!). The items can be found in chests across the world or dropped from bosses that are slain for the first time.
The mod also features a config setting where you can selectively pick the amount of stacks each item occupies, in case you need to tweak/disable the effects. If you want the items you used back, defeat the Wall of Flesh for the **Nullifier** item.

**"Risk of Slime Rain"** is in a beta-stage as of now, offering a fraction of what the end goal is. However, it is still playable! It currently offers:
* 25 items of **Common** rarity - a nice variety of offensive, utility and defensive items.
* 10 items of **Uncommon** rarity - mostly defensive items and a handful of offensive ones.
* 1 boss: **Magma Worm** - Pre-Hardmode, drops his unique boss item.


_Multiplayer compatible, no pvp support._
